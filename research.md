Urban heat island describes how cities have the tendency to be hotter than rural areas. The effect is most evident at night, and so is generally considered to be due to urban-rural differences in how the land and the built environment cool themselves off. This has been observed in cities around the world (with the notable exception of some desert cities, which can act as oases)
